# Do-We-Have-A-Pair
In this assignment I was tasked the following: "Use the keyboard to enter three integers. Determine whether there is at least one pair of equal numbers among them. If such a pair exists, display the numbers separated by a space. If all three numbers are equal, then display all three." This was all completed in the Java programming language.
